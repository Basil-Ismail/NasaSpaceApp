# Quick Setup - Adding Textures (Optional)

## The App Works Without Textures!

The application has fallback visuals, so textures are **completely optional**. They just make it look more realistic.

## If You Want Textures:

### 1. Earth Texture

Download from: https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/73909/december-blue-marble-next-generation-w-topography-and-bathymetry

Or search: "Earth texture 2K" on Google Images

Save as: `/public/textures/earth_daymap.jpg`

### 2. Asteroid Texture

Download from: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/

Or search: "asteroid texture" or "moon texture" on Google Images

Save as: `/public/textures/asteroid.jpg`

### 3. Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## Fallback Visuals (No Textures Needed)

- **Earth**: Blue sphere with basic material
- **Asteroids**: Gray dodecahedron with color tinting based on risk

The app looks great either way!

## Current Status

âœ… App running at http://localhost:3000
âœ… Camera controls working
âœ… 10 meteors visible with orbits
âœ… Textures optional (fallback working)

**Just test it now - looks amazing already!** ðŸš€
